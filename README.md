## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Click "Run" to start the development server
- Edit [App.tsx](#src/App.tsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the Vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### TypeScript

Simply rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. Alternatively, you can use our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)

### Installation of Packages
1. **Install Stripe Integration**:
   ```bash
   npm install @stripe/stripe-js

2. **Install Material-UI**:
   ```bash
   npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

3. **Install Additional Material-UI Packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material react

If you encounter any errors, check the console for missing package installations.
